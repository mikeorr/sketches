        <h1>How to play</h1>
        <p>
          You have four black suits and four red suits, each with ranks:
          <strong>K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The game starts</strong> with several cards dealt randomly
          into four columns of 5 cards and six columns of 4 cards. This is the
          tableau.  The remaining 60 cards form the stock for later play.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each <strong>move</strong>, click a card to select it and all the
          cards below it.  Then click a column to move them to.
          If you decide not to move them after all, click the same column
          to deselect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you reach a <strong>complete suit</strong> of K to A in the same color, it will
          automatically be removed from the tableau and you'll get 13 points
          at the top. When you reach 105 points (all eight suits), you win.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you run out of desired moves, press <strong>"Draw"</strong> to
          deal a random row of cards from the stock to the columns.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Spider the cards you move should be in descending order, one rank
          lower than the bottom of the destination column. For instance, you
          can move 4-3-2 to 5, or to an empty column. And you shouldn't have
          any empty columns when pressing "Draw". The current implementation
          doesn't enforce these restrictions. So you can undo a move by
          doing the opposite move.
        </p>

        <h1>About Spysol</h1>

        <p>
          Spysol was created by Mike Orr, who plays it most nights.
          It's written in modern vanilla Javascript.
          The only library is
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-seedable"
          target="_blank"><code>random-seedable</code></a>
          by Chris Akroyd
          to shuffle the cards.
        </p>

        <p>
          The name "Spysol" is a portmanteau of Spider, Python, and Spy.
          I was originally going to write it in Python, although this
          version isn't.
          The next version will probably be in
          <a href="https://pyscript.net/" target="_blank">PyScript</a>,
          a web version of Python.
       </p>
